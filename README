NOTE: It doesn't look like the moons machines have a recent enough version of numpy to get the top 100 words part to complete, so I can demonstrate that for you if needed

All code is found in naiveBayesClassify.py. Training and testing data is found in the 'data' directory

Requires:
  Python3
  Numpy
  Matplotlib

To run:

>python3 naiveBayesClassify.py


Accuracy and confusion matrix will be printed out for various values of beta. The top 100 words will be printed.  

To see the plot of accuracy vs. beta uncomment at the bottom of naiveBayesClassify.py (also uncomment the import at the top of th page).
